== Process
First you need to open your favorite browser and navigate to http://google.com

[screenshot, name=google1, url=http://google.com, dimension=FRAME_IMAC]
The Google landing page

Then in the input form, write a query like "asciidoctor"

[screenshot, action="browse"]
$("input", name: "q").value("asciidoctor")
$("button", name: "btnG").click()
waitFor(5,0.5){$("h3.r a").size()>0}



[screenshot, dimension=FRAME_BROWSER]
Some propositions should appear

You don't even need to click answers appear in *realtime*

After a while the answer appears, you don't event need to click on a button

Look at the first link and click on it
[screenshot, name=google4, selector="h3.r"]
