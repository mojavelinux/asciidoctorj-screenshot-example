The Google landing page

Then in the input form, write a query like "asciidoctor"

[driveBrowser]
$("input", name: "q").value("asciidoctor")
$("button", name: "btnG").click()
waitFor(5,0.5){$("h3.r a").size()>0}

Some propositions should appear

You don't even need to click answers appear in *realtime*

After a while the answer appears, you don't event need to click on a button
